An Arkanoid inspired action game, made with the Unity 3D Engine.

I originally published this game to the Android app store. This original version contained some commercially licensed external content. To avoid copyright issues, I replaced these textures / music clips by placeholders. This means, that some texture have varying quality. Thank you for your understanding.
